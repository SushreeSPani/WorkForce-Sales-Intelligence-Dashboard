# WorkForce-Sales-Intelligence-Dashboard
This repository contains all the excel related projects
I did my Workforce & Sales Insight Dashboard, and the experience was both challenging and rewarding.
I dived deep into:
🔸 Lookup formulas that helped me connect scattered data smoothly. XLOOKUP quickly became a favourite — flexible and dependable!
🔸 Pivot Tables & Charts that turned confusing datasets into simple visuals with clear meaning.
🔸 Slicers, which brought the dashboard to life — making every analysis interactive and instant.
🔸 KPIs that helped me highlight what decision-makers look for first — performance %, revenue, trends, and more.
🔸 Visual storytelling, where colours, layout, and charts work together to guide attention naturally.
But the best part was developing an analytical mindset — interpreting why a region performs well, what affects delivery times, and how product categories contribute to revenue.
Every element came together to create a dashboard that not only looks good but also communicates effectively.
